# CloneApplePage

## 📖 Description

**CloneApplePage** is a responsive web page inspired by the official Apple website. This project was developed as part of a web development course, where I practiced and honed my skills by creating a clone based on the [iPhone repository by Adrian Hajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/iphone?tab=readme-ov-file). The project focuses on replicating the look and feel of Apple's product pages with high-quality design, smooth user interactions, and advanced animations.
