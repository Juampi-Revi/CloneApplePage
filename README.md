# CloneApplePage

## 📖 Description

**CloneApplePage** is a responsive web page inspired by the official Apple website. This project was developed as part of a web development course, where I practiced and honed my skills by creating a clone based on the [iPhone repository by Adrian Hajdin](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/iphone?tab=readme-ov-file). The project focuses on replicating the look and feel of Apple's product pages with high-quality design, smooth user interactions, and advanced animations.

## 🌟 Features

- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Interactive UI:** Includes animations and hover effects to enhance user engagement.
- **3D Models and Animations:** Integrated 3D models using [THREE.js](https://threejs.org/) and added advanced animations with [GSAP](https://greensock.com/gsap).
- **Error Tracking:** Implemented integration with [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) to monitor and track errors in real-time, ensuring a robust and stable application.
